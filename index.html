<p> I have a wide range of interests in theoretical physics pertaining to non-perturbative aspects of, and emergent phenomena in, quantum matter and field theory. My primary interest at the moment is generalized symmetries, their application to classifying and characterizing condensed matter systems, and their relationship to topological solitons (aka topological defects). I am also interested in topological order, boundaries of topologically ordered phases, emergent gravity in condensed matter, and quantum spin liquids. Additionally, I am interested in quantum algebra and homotopy theory, particularly their applications to physics. <br />
