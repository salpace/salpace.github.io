<p> I am a theorist doing my PhD under Xiao-Gang Wen. I am interested in emergent phenomena in quantum matter/field theory and anything that helps us bridge the microsopic details to the macrosopic physics. I find myself living in the interface of condensed matter theory, high energy theory, and mathematical physics. <br />
My primary interest at the moment is generalized symmetries and 't Hooft anomalies. This includes their applications to phases of quantum matter, phase transitions, and tensor gauge theories. </p>

<p> You can find my papers on the arXiv, <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/advanced?advanced=&terms-0-term=Pace%2C+Salvatore&terms-0-operator=AND&terms-0-field=author&classification-physics=y&classification-physics_archives=all&classification-include_cross_list=include&date-filter_by=all_dates&date-year=&date-from_date=&date-to_date=&date-date_type=submitted_date_first&abstracts=hide&size=50&order=-announced_date_first">here</a>. </p>
