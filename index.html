<p> I have a wide range of interests in theoretical physics pertaining to emergent phenomena in quantum matter and non-perturbative aspects of field theories. My primary interest at the moment is generalized symmetries, their application to classifying and characterizing condensed matter systems, and their relationship to topological solitons (aka topological defects). I am also thinking about topological order, SPTs, gapless quantum spin liquids, emergent gravity in condensed matter, and applications of quantum algebra or homotopy theory to physics. <br />
