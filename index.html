<p> I have a wide range of interests in theoretical physics pertaining to non-perturbative aspects of quantum field theories, with applications to quantum matter and mathematical physics. My primary interest at the moment is generalized symmetries. Particularly: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
        (1) continuous non-invertible symmetries,<br>
        (2) applications to classifying quantum many-body phases and phase transitions,<br>
        (3) generalized symmetries arising from topologically protected defects (e.g., vortices, disclinations, hedgehogs) and their applications to quantum disordering. </p>
<p> I am also interested in topological order, symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, emergent gravity in quantum matter, UV/IR mixing, and applications of homological algebra to physics. In the past, I have worked on these topics as well as quantum spin liquids and dynamical systems.<br />
