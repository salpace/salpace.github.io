<p>Currently a 5th-year physics PhD student at MIT<br /> I will be starting a postdoc at IAS in Fall 2026</p>

<p> I am a theoretical physicist broadly interested in the quantum physics of many degrees of freedom, ranging from quantum field theories to quantum lattice models and condensed matter systems. I primarily explore questions in this area using (generalized) symmetries and anomalies, bridging ideas from quantum field theory, condensed matter theory, mathematical physics, and quantum information. Two themes run through my work. The first is quantum phases of matter. I am interested in characterizing and classifying exotic quantum phases, including gapped phases within and beyond the framework of topological quantum field theory, as well as gapless phases. The second theme is the interplay between quantum field theories and lattice models. There is a long and fruitful symbiotic relationship between these two subjects. I am interested in understanding the structural aspects of quantum field theories and lattice models, as well as the relationship between the abstract spaces of all quantum field theories and lattice models.   

<p> You can see my CV, <a href="Salvatore_Pace_CV.pdf"> here</a>, which includes a list of my papers and talks with links to slides and recordings.  

<p> You can also find all of my papers on Google Scholar, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pAwQrwEAAAAJ&hl=en">here</a>. </p>

</p>Currently, I am mostly thinking about:
<ul>
        <li>Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorems from modulated symmetries</li>
        <li>New anomalies of quantum lattice models and their anomaly matching conditions</li>
        <li>Higher-group symmetries in quantum lattice models</li>
        <li>Topological melting of quantum crystals and nematics</li>
        <li>The Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT)</li>
</ul>  

<p>More broadly, I am interested in:
<ul>
        <li>Topological phases of matter and topological quantum field theory.</li>
        <li>’t&nbsp;Hooft anomalies, Lieb–Schultz–Mattis theorems, and their relations.</li>
        <li>Generalized symmetries and gauging in quantum lattice models.</li>
        <li>Family anomalies and generalized Thouless pumps in parametrized quantum systems.</li>
        <li>Foliated field theories, tensor gauge theories, and applications to elasticity and quantum melting.</li>
        <li>Quantum spin liquids and frustrated magnets.</li>
        <li>Applications of category and homotopy theory to physics.</li>
        <li>Applications of quantum information theory to quantum many-body systems.</li>
</ul>
