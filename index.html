<p> I am a theorist doing my Ph.D. under Xiao-Gang Wen and have a wide range of interests pertaining to emergent phenomena in quantum matter and field theory. My primary interest at the moment is generalized symmetries, their application to classifying and characterizing condensed matter systems, and their relationship to topological solitons (aka topological defects). I am also interested in topological order, boundaries of topologically ordered phases, emergent gravity in condensed matter, and quantum spin liquids. I also have interests in quantum algebra and homotopy theory, particularly their applications to physics <br />

<p> You can find all of my papers on Google scholar, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pAwQrwEAAAAJ&hl=en">here</a>. </p>

<p> Here is where my physics journey so far has taken me:<br /><br />

2021-present: MIT (NSF GRFP), PhD in physics<br />
2020-2021: University of Cambridge (Churchill Scholarship), MPhil in physics. <br />
2016-2020: Boston University, Bachelors and Masters in physics.
