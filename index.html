<p> I have a wide range of interests in theoretical physics pertaining to non-perturbative aspects of quantum field theories and their applications to quantum matter and mathematical physics. My primary interest at the moment is generalized symmetries, their application to classifying phases & phase transitions of quanum matter, and their relationship to homotopy defects (e.g., vortices, disclinations, hedgehogs). I am also interested topological order, symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, quantum disordering, emergent gravity in condensed matter, and applications of category theory/homotopy theory to physics. <br />
