<p> I'm a theoretical physicist interested in formal and non-perturbative aspects of quantum many-body systems (i.e., quantum field theories) with applications to condensed matter, mathematical, and high energy physics. The primary goals of my research are to understand better (1) what possible universal phenomena, phases, and phase transitions can emerge in quantum many-body systems and (2) how such emergent, macroscopic phenomena can depend on microscopic details. I am primarily approaching these questions using generalized symmetries and am currently working on: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
        (1) generalized symmetries arising from topologically protected excitations (e.g., vortices, disclinations, hedgehogs) and their applications to quantum disordering transitions (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05730">arXiv:2308.05730</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08554">arXiv:2310.08554</a>), <br>
        (2) using emergent generalized symmetries to classify quantum many-body phases and phase transitions (see <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.108.195147">PRB 108, 195147</a>),<br>
        (3) non-invertible symmetries in Hamiltonian lattice models.</p>
<p> More broadly, I am interested in  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
        (1) all things topological phases of matter, from topological orders to SETs to SPTs. Anything whose low energy effective theory is described by something without rulers and clocks - a topological (quantum) field theory (see <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.106.045145">PRB 106, 045145</a> and <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.107.075112">PRB 107, 075112</a>),<br>
        (2) UV/IR mixing, both with and without fractons (see <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.106.045145">PRB 106, 045145</a> and <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.107.155151">PRB 107, 155151</a>),<br>
        (3) tensor gauge theories and their application to emergent gravity, elasticity, and topological orders (see <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.106.045145">PRB 106, 045145</a> and <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.107.155151">PRB 107, 155151</a>), <br>
        (4) quantum spin liquids and frustrated magnets (see <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.117205">PRL 127, 117205</a> and <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.130.076701">PRL 130, 076701</a>),<br>
        (5) applications of higher category and homotopy theory to physics (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05730">arXiv:2308.05730</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08554">arXiv:2310.08554</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09293">arXiv:2311.09293</a>),</p> 
</p>
Amazingly, all of these topics can be understood in a unified fashion with generalized symmetries! I am starting to get interested in applying formal methods familiar to the study of topological phases to quantum dynamics, but I haven't done anything yet. If your interests overlap with mine and you'd like to chat, please don't hesitate to email me :)<br />
