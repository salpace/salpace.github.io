<p> I'm a theoretical physicist interested in non-perturbative aspects of many-body systems (i.e., field theories) using symmetry and topology, with applications to quantum matter, statistical mechanics, and high energy physics. Two goals of my research are to better understand (1) what possible phenomena can emerge from quantum mechanics and (2) how universal macroscopic phenomena depend on microscopic details. Currently, I am mostly working on generalized symmetries, and am particularly interested in: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
        (1) continuous non-invertible symmetries,<br>
        (2) applications of generalized symmetries to classifying quantum many-body phases and phase transitions,<br>
        (3) generalized symmetries arising from topologically protected defects (e.g., vortices, disclinations, hedgehogs) and their applications to quantum disordering. </p>
<p> I am also interested in topological phases of matter, emergent gravity, UV/IR mixing, applying the formal methods used in studying topological phases to quantum dynamics, and applications of homological algebra to physics. In the past, I have worked on quantum spin liquids and dynamical systems.<br />
