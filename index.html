<p> I'm a theoretical physicist interested in formal and non-perturbative aspects of quantum many-body systems/quantum field theories with applications to condensed matter, mathematical, and high-energy physics. The primary goals of my research are to understand better (1) what possible universal phenomena, phases, and phase transitions can emerge in quantum many-body systems and (2) how such emergent, macroscopic phenomena can depend on microscopic details. I am approaching these questions using various aspects of (generalized) symmetries and topology, and am currently working on: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
        (1) higher-categorical symmetries arising from topologically protected excitations (e.g., vortices, disclinations, hedgehogs) and their applications to quantum disordering transitions, <br>
        (2) spontaneously broken modulated 0-form and higher-form symmetries in various dimensions with applications from elasticity to gravity,<br>
        (3) non-invertible and higher-categorical symmetries in Hamiltonian lattice models with a tensor product Hilbert space,<br>
<p> More broadly, I am interested in  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
        (1) all things topological phases of matter, from topological orders to SETs to SPTs. Anything whose low energy effective theory is described by something without rulers and clocks - a topological (quantum) field theory,<br>
        (2) UV/IR mixing, both with and without fractons,<br>
        (3) tensor gauge theories and their application to emergent gravity, elasticity and quantum melting, and symmetry enriched topological orders, <br>
        (4) quantum spin liquids and frustrated magnets,<br>
        (5) applications of higher category and homotopy theory to physics,<br>
        (6) I am starting to get interested in applying formal methods familiar to the study of topological phases to quantum dynamics, but I haven't done anything yet.</p>

<p> When I am not dreaming about physics and math, you can find me at the closest source of coffee, at the climbing gym dangling from a rope, or in the mosh pit of your nearest punk show (you should totally check out my favorite paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1886">arXiv:1302.1886</a>!)</a>.
