<p> I'm a theoretical physicist interested in formal and non-perturbative aspects of quantum many-body systems (i.e., quantum field theories) with applications to condensed matter, mathematical, and high energy physics. The primary goals of my research are to understand better (1) what possible universal phenomena, phases, and phase transitions can emerge in quantum many-body systems and (2) how such emergent, macroscopic phenomena can depend on microscopic details. I am primarily approaching these questions using generalized symmetries and am working on: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
        (1) generalized symmetries arising from topologically protected excitations (e.g., vortices, disclinations, hedgehogs) and their applications to quantum disordering transitions (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05730">arXiv:2308.05730</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08554">arXiv:2310.08554</a>), <br>
        (2) using emergent generalized symmetries to classify quantum many-body phases and phase transitions (see <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.108.195147">PRB 108 195147</a>),<br>
        (3) non-invertible symmetries in Hamiltonian lattice models.</p>
<p> I am also interested in all things topological phases of matter (i.e., topological orders, SETs, and SPTs), UV/IR mixing, tensor gauge theories and their application to elasticity and topological matter, emergent gravity, gapped fracton phases, quantum spin liquids, and applications of higher category theory to physics. I am starting to get interested in applying formal methods familiar to the study of topological phases to quantum dynamics, but I haven't done anything yet. If your interests overlap with mine and you'd like to chat, please don't hesitate to email me :)<br />
