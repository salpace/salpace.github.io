<p> I'm a theoretical physicist interested in non-perturbative aspects of quantum many-body systems, from quantum field theories to quantum lattice models and condensed matter systems. My research primarily centers around quantum phases and their transitions, aiming to classify and characterize related emergent quantum phenomena and understand their dependence on microscopic details. I am currently leveraging generalized symmetries to explore such emergent phenomena. This exciting interdisciplinary approach bridges the domains of quantum field theory, condensed matter theory, mathematical physics, and quantum information. 

</p>Currently, I'm investigating:
<ul>
        <li>Generalizations of the bulk boundary correspondence using the SymTFT framework, with applications to classifying gapped and gapless quantum phases of matter.</li>
        <li>Symmetries of lattice fermion models and their connections to 't Hooft anomalies in quantum field theories of fermions.</li>
        <li>How interplays between crystalline and internal symmetries affect quantum criticality and thermodynamic limits through UV/IR mixing.</li>
</ul>  

<p>More broadly, I am interested in:
<ul>
        <li>All things topological phases of matter and topological quantum field theory.</li>
        <li>'t Hooft anomalies, Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorems, and their relations.</li>
        <li>Non-invertible symmetries in quantum lattice models.</li>
        <li>Family-anomalies and generalized Thouless pumps in parametrized quantum systems.</li>
        <li>Foliated field theories, tensor gauge theories, and their applications to elasticity and quantum melting.</li>
        <li>Quantum spin liquids and frustrated magnets in three-dimensions.</li>
        <li>Applications of higher category and homotopy theory to generalized symmetries and physics generally.</li>
        <li>Applications of quantum information theory to quantum many-body systems.</li>
</ul>  
If your interests overlap with mine and you'd like to chat, please don't hesitate to email me! </p>


<p> When I am not dreaming about physics and math, you can find me at the closest source of coffee, at the climbing gym dangling from a rope, or in the mosh pit of your nearest punk show (you should check out my favorite paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1886">arXiv:1302.1886</a>!)</a>.
