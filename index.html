<p> I'm a theoretical physicist interested in non-perturbative aspects of many-body systems (i.e., field theories) with applications to quantum matter, statistical mechanics, and high energy physics. The primary goals of my research are to better understand (1) what possible phenomena and phases can emerge from many-body systems and (2) how such emergent phenomena can depend on microscopic details. I am currently working on generalized symmetries, and am particularly interested in: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
        (1) continuous non-invertible symmetries,<br>
        (2) generalized symmetries arising from topologically protected defects (e.g., vortices, disclinations, hedgehogs) and their applications to quantum disordering, <br>
        (3) using generalized symmetries to classify quantum many-body phases and phase transitions.</p>
<p> I am also interested in topological phases of matter (i.e., topological orders and SPTs), emergent gravity, UV/IR mixing, applying the formal methods used in studying topological phases to quantum dynamics, and applications of homological algebra to physics. In the past, I have worked on quantum spin liquids and dynamical systems.<br />
