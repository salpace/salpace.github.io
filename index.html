<p> I am a theorist doing my Ph.D. under Xiao-Gang Wen and have a wide range of interests pertaining to emergent phenomena in quantum matter and field theory. My primary interest at the moment is generalized symmetries and 't Hooft anomalies, including their applications to classifying phases of matter, characterizing phase transitions, and symmetric tensor gauge theories. I am also interested in topological order, boundaries of topologically ordered phases, quantum algebra/topology, emergent gravity in condensed matter, quantum spin liquids, and topologically protected defects in ordered media. <br />

<p> You can find my papers on the arXiv, <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/advanced?advanced=&terms-0-term=Pace%2C+Salvatore&terms-0-operator=AND&terms-0-field=author&classification-physics=y&classification-physics_archives=all&classification-include_cross_list=include&date-filter_by=all_dates&date-year=&date-from_date=&date-to_date=&date-date_type=submitted_date_first&abstracts=hide&size=50&order=-announced_date_first">here</a>, or on Google scholar, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pAwQrwEAAAAJ&hl=en">here</a>. </p>

<p> Here is where my physics journey so far has taken me:<br /><br />

2021-present: MIT (NSF GRFP), PhD in physics<br />
2020-2021: University of Cambridge (Churchill Scholarship), MPhil in physics. <br />
2016-2020: Boston University, Bachelors and Masters in physics.
