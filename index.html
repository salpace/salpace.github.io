<p> I'm a theoretical physicist interested in understanding non-perturbative aspects of many-body systems (i.e., field theories) using symmetry and topology, with applications to quantum matter, statistical mechanics, and mathematical physics. My primary interest at the moment is generalized symmetries, particularly: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
        (1) continuous non-invertible symmetries,<br>
        (2) applications to classifying quantum many-body phases and phase transitions,<br>
        (3) generalized symmetries arising from topologically protected defects (e.g., vortices, disclinations, hedgehogs) and their applications to quantum disordering. </p>
<p> I am also interested in topological phases of matter, emergent gravity, UV/IR mixing, applications of homological algebra to physics, and applying formal methods used in studying topological phases to quantum dynamics. In the past, I also worked on quantum spin liquids and dynamical systems.<br />
